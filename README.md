Rosa is a biological researcher in a prominent microbiology laboratory. Many of these bacterial species are not well-studied, and many more remain unknown to science. Rosa's role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular, Rosa is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species. Rosa has a hypothesis that there's a microorganism that can provide the next best taste, and she believes it can be found close to home, from bacteria found on the human body. Here is a small sampling of her findings so far. A simple website was built using JavaScript and HTML to visualize information.
